**Spotonix Internship**

This project is about analyzing userâ€™s natural language queries related to business intelligence data.
LLMs are used to analyze the query and various business elements are identified in the query using appropriate prompting. The project involves experimenting with multiple frameworks for querying LLMs and to identify best prompting mechanisms. 
Following frameworks will be used:
OpenAI chat completion protocol
Instructor Package
Dspy Framework

The dataset used for testing is TPCDS benchmark which consists of a schema definitions as well as 99 queries in natural language as well as SQL. 
The project will involve python programming with above frameworks, and testing all TPCDS queries.
The OpenAI LLM will be used, and other LLMs like LLama2 as a stretch goal.
